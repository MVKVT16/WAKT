            "Q": "How does \"Find nearby artworks\" works if the artwork does not have coordiantes?",
            "A": "In order for \"Find nearby artworks\" to work, the user must have at least one artwork nearby that has coordinates. Then all artworks that are in the same list on Wikipedia are shown. The artworks are sorted into lists by municipality and region."

        "Q2": {
            "Q": "Why should I log in?",
            "A": "You can log in with you Wikipedia account with oAuth to write changes directly to Wikipedia. Your changes will then be added directly to the artwork in the list, with your Wikipedia account as author. If you choose not to log in you can edit coordinates anonymously and your changes will be added as suggestions to Wikipedias discussion page for the relevant list."

            "A": "On iPhone, go to Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services -> Safari. Change to \"While using\". On Android you first have to make sure that you do not use Chrome. Then, go to Settings -> Loacation. Change to \"On\"."

        "Q4": {
            "Q": "Why does not \"Find nearby artworks\" and \"Map\" work when I use Chrome?",
            "A": "Chrome does not allow location services for Web pages using HTTP but only for Web pages that use HTTPS, which WAKT currently does not support."
        },
        "Q5": {
            "Q": "Is my position stored?",
            "A": "Your position is only used to find nearby artworks and locate you on the map, and not saved anywhere. However if you select your position as the position of an artwork it will of course be saved in ÖDOK and our database of changes."
        },
        "Q6": {
            "Q": "How does the process work when I suggest coordinates or changes?",
            "A": "The changed from WAKT are published on Wikipedia , either as suggestions on the discussion page or directly in the list. Every 24 hours ÖDOK, Öppen Databas för Offentlig Konst, reads these lists and saves the result in their open database. ÖDOK’s API is then publicly available and used by for example WAKT to show the positions of artworks."
        },
        "Q7": {
            "Q": "Why can't I see my changes?",
            "A": "Your changes are saved directly on Wikipedia if you are logged in (or as a suggestion otherwise). The database are updated every night and it may therefore take up to 24 hours before your changes us available in WAKT."
